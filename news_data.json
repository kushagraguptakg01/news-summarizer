The operation leveraged #IndianNavy's comprehensive layered Fleet Air Defence mechanism, enabling quick and clear distinction between commercial, neutral and hostile aircraft or flying objects, and neutralisation of threats at extended ranges. The #CarrierBattleGroup with its integral Air Wing provides the first layer of this layered mechanism. The presence of our #AircraftCarrier with a large number of Mig 29K fighters and Air Borne Early Warning helicopters prevented any suspicious or hostile aircraft from closing within several hundred kilometres. Our powerful CBG, with formidable offensive capability was able to operate with impunity and maintained an uncontested presence in the area of operations, compelling the Pakistani Air Elements to remain bottled up close to the coast denying any opportunity to be a threat in maritime space. The #IndianNavy’s dominance thus ensured that should we choose to, we can strike at will. #OperationSindoor @SpokespersonMoD @HQ_IDS_India @adgpi @IAF_MCC"

His flight was forced to rapidly descend from 35,000 ft to 15,000 ft by Ahmedabad ATC while entering Indian airspace near Jamnagar. The ATC’s instructions were non-routine, sudden and firm. Why? Because Pakistani drone/aircraft activity in the Sir Creek area had alerted Indian authorities. This descent wasn’t normal; it was a calculated measure to protect the aircraft amidst hostilities. Clear proof of what the Indian Government has been saying: Pakistan kept its airspace open during an air battle, recklessly endangering civil flights, even using them as potential shields. For my friend, it was surreal — he only found out the scale of the confrontation after landing. This is Pakistan gambling with human lives—in this case international passengers—plain and simple. @icao @DGCAIndia"

Key insights: •India’s air defense is layered and modern, blending indigenous systems like Akash & QRSAM with Israeli Barak-8 and Russian S-400. •This integration enables India to not only defend its airspace but also penetrate Chinese-built systems used by adversaries like Pakistan. •Pakistan’s reliance on HQ-9/P, LY-80, and FM-90 has proven vulnerable to India’s mix of electronic warfare, kinetic strikes, and flexible doctrine. •The core lesson: It’s not about what you buy. It’s about how you integrate it. •The Ukraine conflict echoes the same message globally survivability depends on intelligent integration, not just hardware. New India’s evolving air defense is not just a regional advantage-it’s a case study for modern warfare. open.substack.com/pub/spence… #IndiaDefense",

So, the entire country is expressing gratitude to the Indian armed forces. Operation Sindoor is not just a military operation but also the symbol of India's political, social and strategic willpower. This operation against terrorism was also the display of India's willpower and military power & capability. We have shown that whenever India will take any action against terrorism, even the land beyond border won't be safe for terrorists and their leaders. Indian armed forces launched Operatoon Sindoor to demolish terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. We never targeted their civilians. But Pakistan not only targeted civilian areas in India but also attempted to attack temples, gurdwaras and churches. With valour and bravery, Indian armed forces displayed restraint and gave a befitting reply by targeting other locations in Pakistan. We not only targeted military bases near the border but the reverberation of Indian armed forces was heard even in Rawalpindi where the HQ of Pakistani Army is located. After Uri incident, the entire world saw what is the result of carrying terrorist attacks in India, when our armed forces entered Pakistan and carried out surgical strike. They saw it after Pulwama, when Balakot airstrike was done. After Pahalgam incident, the world is watching when India entered Pakistan and carried out multiple strikes. Following the path of zero tolerance against terrorism, our PM Narendra Modi has made it clear that it is 'Naya Bharat' which will take effective steps against terrorism on both sides of the border. Our PM has made this very clear.\""

As Indian armed forces start teaching the terrorist country Pakistan a lesson, we may naturally see some losses to our forces. Losses are part of any conflict. It is the end result that matters. In 1971, Pakistan was split into two in just under two weeks. But in those two weeks, India lost 45 planes, 1 frigate, 2500+ soldiers. India also had a few thousand of our soldiers captured, and many Indian air fields and bases were destroyed. This is how wars are. Don't be in any fantasies, and prepare your mind to be as strong as our soldier on the field. Remember, it is the end result that matters. Pakistan was not just split in two, but tens of thousands of soldiers were killed, and 90,000+ were captured. The rest surrendered on their knees. So don't fall for propaganda that will come from across the borders when we see an Indian air craft downed or a soldier captured. Their propaganda power is immense to affect our psychology as a nation. Because they have their sympathizers and political agents well within in India. And, it is now the age of social media. We haven't had any big conflict in this age. So beware of the extraordinary psyops and always support our brave armed forces risking their lives for us, for whatever decisions they take."

The world has seen the precision with which New India has used new age warfare and weapons to establish a new normal to systematically destroy the Universities of Terrorism in Bahawalpur and Muridke. The world has witnessed how we dispatched more than 100 hardcore terrorists and their masters to burning fires of hell. मिट्टी में मिला दिया। The force and strength with which India came down on terror infrastructure and Pakistani military installations & bases shows there will be no compromise on the terror front - Zero Tolerance. There will be no nuclear blackmail. ▪️Terror and talks WILL NOT go hand in hand. ▪️Terror and trade WILL NOT coexist. ▪️Blood and water WILL NOT flow together. Such was the potent power of India’s resolve that the Pakistanis came to India on their knees pleading for a halt in the hammering our armed forces were giving them.

                        "tweet_content": "This is my simplified understanding of what happened between May 7th, to the May 10th \"ceasefire.\" April 22-May 7: 1) India, having already taken many punitive measures to squeeze the economy of Pak, decides to also impose military costs May 6 night - May 7: 2) Indian armed forces bomb the hell out of 9 terrorist sites based on intel, multiple times, killing 100+ terrorists and flattening their camps. 3) India's message is loud and clear. There will be severe costs including targeted killings of terrorists. \"We can hit you anywhere, anytime, even after announcing we will hit giving 2 weeks to prepare, and you still can't do anything about it.\" 4) This is the message India wanted to deliver and the objectives were clearly met. But India was also ready for escalations by Pak. May 7 - May 8: 5) Pak escalates with drone attacks and India retaliates even harder. Taking out all their air defences and systems. 6) India again gives an off-ramp. \"You can take take it and walk away. But if you hit, we will hit harder. You can't do anything.\" May 8 - May 9: 7) US (JD) calls India, directly speaks to PM Modi, who was kind enough to take his call, JD tells they have intel that Pak is planning for a devastating missile attack. 8) PM Modi says, and am paraphrasing, \"Ok. Let them try it, we will devastate them.\" Hangs up. 9) India also makes it clear that if Pak wants ceasefire, the DGMO must himself call and declare it. We don't want to talk to political puppets. 10) But again that night Pak sends a barrage of drones and missiles. Including ballistic missiles, presumably targeting Delhi. All taken down by India's world's best, integrated air defence successfully. Yes, I will say it again. From what we have seen, India's integrated air defence system is now the world's best. Even better than Iron Dome but operating at a fraction of its cost. Kudos to our engineers and military. May 9 - May 10: 10) India pummels Pakistani air bases by dawn. Its hangars with planes are destroyed. Its runways are cratered. All its Chinese air defences are taken out. May 10: 10) Pak pleads to US to ask India to stop. US sec. of state, Marco Rubio, calls around 1pm IST? India makes it clear Pak DGMO needs to call and confirm he wants a ceasefire. India won't talk to anyone else. 11) Pakistan DGMO calls India around 3-4pm IST. Offers cessation of all fire in all domains. India accepts it with the condition any violation or terror attack can be seen as an act of war. May be there were other demands we do not yet know about? Like return of some terrorists under US guarantee. 12) Pak leaks the news to the US. Trump wakes up by 5 pm IST and claims he's the one who brokered the ceasefire to show himself and US as a peace maker. And also to show the US as more influential than China. 13) By 6pm, Dr. Jaishankar tweets of an \"agreement reached\" between India and Pakistan. He doesn't call it a ceasefire. He also doesn't talk about any US role. 14) Pakistan starts its propaganda of winning the war. International media and Trump tweet make it look like India had to agree to a ceasefire. 15) Pysops makes Indians a bit disillusioned. There's a sentiment that India must have not agreed to the \"ceasefire\" and hit Pakistan further. May 11: 16) Things clear up a bit. DGMO press conference is really morale boosting for Indians. They present the exact picture and how badly India had mauled Pakistan with all the proof. 17) Indians, including me, are quite happy and contented about the robust response of India and the powerful message delivered to Pak. PM Modi said we will hit all the terrorists, and those behind it and those who manage the show. India did exactly that: - 100+ terrorists dead avenging terror attacks right from 2001. - Pak military sites and bases hit, let them count the body bags. - Chinese defence systems made to look utterly useless. It is a big message to China and all the powers that are watching, no matter what is their civilian propaganda. Though we all like a little more action to put Pak in place, we also know India can get pulled into a wider war affecting our economy badly and expending our military against other threats. What we have achieved in amazing. Thanks to the resolve of our leadership and bravery of our armed forces. Jai hind. Note: This is just my understanding of the events. There may be mistakes and gaps. Feel free to correct me in the replies."

Just because Trump talks to Pak PM and announces ceasefire, it means nothing. In fact, just to snub him the anti-Trump admin DS and its master China will make Pak army fire at us. They will not only provoke us after this to make Modi look weak (if he decides to ignore their provocations) and as under pressure from the US, but also to make Trump look small. Also, remember, China wants India to be in a full scale war with Pakistan. So what will India now? Is it going to take the hits and not do anything to prevent further escalation?

For the first time in modern history, India’s Air Force pierced deep into Pakistan’s airspace, struck surgically and successfully and Pakistan admitted it! Their counterstrikes? A joke. Their air defenses? Shattered. Lahore lit up in panic. Did we want more? Of course. A full sweep. But when my Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, decides the scale of response I trust it. Because the world finally saw what India is becoming: a nation unafraid, unapologetic, and unbreakable. And yet, while our forces were defending Bharat’s izzat, some leaders from the Opposition were busy feeding enemy narratives questioning Pahalgam, calling it a false flag, and parroting propaganda that Pakistani media used word-for-word. That’s not dissent. That’s treachery. That’s an insult to every soldier standing on the border. Modi didn’t just change the way we vote-he changed the way India strikes back. No more candle marches. No more silence. This is New India. And we don’t kneel we retaliate. Jai Hind. Jai Bharat. Also if not me just listen to Shiv Aroor’s coverage as it isn’t just reporting its patriotism in motion. Unflinching, razor-sharp, and rooted in facts, he brings clarity when propaganda clouds the truth. In times of war or peace, he’s a voice every Indian can trust.

Operation Sindoor has unequivocally established India's strategic military dominance in Asia. But at the same time, when the imperative need of the hour is national unity, the Congress party is politicising this whole situation by peddling fake narratives and showing baseless suspicions. This behaviour of the Congress party is reprehensible, especially at a time when the Indian Air Force has said operations are still underway. We have seen Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi asking for a special session of parliament... How do you call a session of parliament and discuss intricate details of national security?... After the statement from the MEA came, the Congress started comparing 2025 to 1971. How unfortunate is that? Everybody knows that in 1971, in fact, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw had said that Indira Gandhi forfeited the great victories brought by the Indian Armed Forces in 1971 in the Simla agreement and it was a great setback for India... We see what Operation Sindoor has done. The brave armed forces have destroyed 9 terror bases and 4 of them in Pakistan, killing hundreds of terrorists. Also, the Indian armed forces have decimated 11 Pakistan military installations and Pakistan air bases. Never has this been done before. So to draw a parallel between 1971 and 2025 is a folly. The Congress party should start playing a responsible role as the principal opposition and try to stand by national unity. And once again, we take this opportunity to thank our brave armed forces and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and we implicitly trust in our brave defence personnel and the leadership of the Prime Minister.\""

After 11.30 pm last night, there is a ceasefire at India-Pakistan border. The situation is normal...When terrorists killed 26 innocent people in Pahalgam, PM had said that this we will not only raze the terrorists to ground but we will also punish their leaders in a way which they would not have imagined. That is what India intended and Indian armed forces fulfilled that with their valour. Pakistan's 9 terrorist camps were demolished in precision attacks. Indian armed forces never targetted any Pakistani civilian in this action. They violated ceasefire at the LoC for 14 consecutive days. They targetted our civilian areas and Gurdwaras. Our action was nothing like theirs. Our aim was to neutralise and erase those terrorists...\""

Which is the reason for the terror attack drawing us into a war. Perhaps India decided it won't play China's game and agreed to ceasefire though it will be a loss of face for Modi govt. But they can manage it internally as main elections are far away. So from tonight it will be claimed that some local commanders of Pak army unknowingly shelled, it is now calm, there is no violation of ceasefire to hold it. Pak and China run deep state media world over will mock India, Modi, Trump tomorrow and get away. We all will feel frustrated seeing their headlines seemingly suggesting India lost. Ceasefire may hold for sometime. But again China will instruct pak to break it. It will, at will, provoke India to respond. Or put our leadership in a decision dielema. We are, just because of this agreement, become a prisoner of Pak-China harkat at their will. That's all I will say. So, even if by tomorrow India claims no ceasefire violation and everything is calm, expect Pak to break it anytime later. Hope India has a tough answer then. Not to Pak but to China directly."

Here's why: This Trump presidency will be entirely backed by the new deep state. See my reply in this thread below. The deep state operates irrespective of who's running the state. Trump acted clueless when the DS stirred up CAA protests and Delhi riots in India even as he was visiting. It will be the same, or worse, for India with respect to the US DS and its meddling in India's region. Another issue the military lobby is also backing Trump this time. So is the oil and commercial lobby, or basically a big chunk of the Military Industrial Commercial Complex of the US is backing Trump. This means India will also face direct pressure from the Trump admin on buying US weapons, face tariffs on exports, and arm twisting on letting in US pharma and other commercial interests. India will be forced to cut imports of Russian oil and even buy oil directly from the US which will flow in plenty by next year. No discounted, rupee traded, Iran oil, Russian oil or Venezuelan oil for India. Do you see the implications? India will get double whammy from both the state and the deep state. The only consolation is PM Modi has a good personal relationship with President Trump and Trump is known to be very pragmatic, business like, and independent in his decision making. Given this good equation, if India buys a number of weapons and planes from the US, lets in Starlink, Tesla, and other US commerce without trouble, and works with the US against China, all will be good in India, sans the neighborhood where USDS will continue to meddle. This is the most likely situation for India from the next year. PM Modi and his govt are very pragmatic in foreign policy. They understand the US power, and won't take the US head-on if the DS is kept in check by the Trump admin to not internally destabilize India and let India grow. But the next few months, until Trump admin takes full charge, it will be the DS utilizing the time and attacking India to the maximum."

There are 2 two reasons why we saw the US jump in the way it did to push for a ceasefire. The first reason is escalation dynamics. This was a crisis that escalated very quickly. You had significant levels of military action that were used by both sides...The second reason is the nuclear issue.

The propaganda must be done so much that for the next three generations, Indians must look down on American arms. This must be the lesson for the US arms lobby rewarding Pakistan using their state, and for Trump announcing the ceasefire before India like its his achievement. Just think about this, it is the US that has approached India on behalf of Pakistan for a ceasefire. India's objective was already achieved on May 7th with the intensive strikes against terrorists killing 70+ and flattening many of their pads. That's the message India wanted to give. And delivered. It is due to Pakistan's escalation that India had to retaliate for two more days. Everyday India gave an off-ramp for Pak which it didn't take. But once India struck their bases hard and destroyed air defences, Pakistan has gone crying to the US to help it stop India. This must have been done by Pakistan prostituting itself again in US interests for sure, by leaving the bed of China for time being. And the US steps in, asks India to accept Pak's ceasefire which anyway India wants. And once we agree, it acts like it is the peace broker. Just imgine if there was just 1 hour for PM Modi to appear on TV and announce the ceasefire himself. Telling us how badly Pak has been hit, and how India doesn't want this to spiral out, affecting us in the long term. And how the main objectives of imposing serious costs on Pakistan and teaching them a lesson was met. But the US, especially Trump, did not give the opportunity at all. This is nothing but shameless, courtesyless behavior. This is a direct snub to India. And I think India must take actions to ensure the US arms lobby that props up Pak pays. In fact, I really feel India must do just one more strike on Pak for yesterday's ceasefire violations and throw an egg on Trump's face while declaring ceasefire ourselves after the strike."

We must tell Donald Trump and America that if they are India's friends, they should help practically. We require technological intelligence, high-end technology, and drones. They should focus on this rather than giving us advice... Pakistan violated the ceasefire yesterday because it wants to start a grey zone warfare. This means that by sending drones over us, for which we have to enforce blackouts, they are harming our economic activity and airfields... So we have to give the same treatment to Pakistan. A five times harsher punishment must meet every action of theirs so they think twice before carrying out the next ceasefire violation.\""

Once we get these wreckages or pieces that we recover, we can reverse engineer and very well understand the Chinese technology which goes into the weapons that the Pakistanis had used. Similarly, the Turkish SONGAR drones and other drones. Now we can reengineer and find out better what electronics jammers and what engineering is there in the Chinese drones or missiles which Pakistan has used. This would be helpful to us in the future situation with China. So this is gold for us.\""
