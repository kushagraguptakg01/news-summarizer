This operation against terrorism was also the display of India's willpower and military power & capability. We have shown that whenever India will take any action against terrorism, even the land beyond border won't be safe for terrorists and their leaders. Indian armed forces launched Operatoon Sindoor to demolish terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. We never targeted their civilians. But Pakistan not only targeted civilian areas in India but also attempted to attack temples, gurdwaras and churches. With valour and bravery, Indian armed forces displayed restraint and gave a befitting reply by targeting other locations in Pakistan. We not only targeted military bases near the border but the reverberation of Indian armed forces was heard even in Rawalpindi where the HQ of Pakistani Army is located. After Uri incident, the entire world saw what is the result of carrying terrorist attacks in India, when our armed forces entered Pakistan and carried out surgical strike. They saw it after Pulwama, when Balakot airstrike was done. After Pahalgam incident, the world is watching when India entered Pakistan and carried out multiple strikes. Following the path of zero tolerance against terrorism, our PM Narendra Modi has made it clear that it is 'Naya Bharat' which will take effective steps against terrorism on both sides of the border. Our PM has made this very clear.\""

Col Sofiya Qureshi confirmed the destruction of Pakistan's offensive and defensive capabilities and significant damage to their military assets. She refuted Pakistani misinformation, including claims of damaging India's S400/Brahmos bases or airfields, and denied Indian military damaged mosques in Pakistan (a claim Pakistan had made), emphasizing India's secular nature and that operations targeted only terrorist camps and anti-India facilities. The Indian MoD officially indicated that India’s relentless punitive strikes on Pak bases (updated list: Nur Khan/Chaklala, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skardu, Bholari, Jacobabad) led to the ceasefire, confirming future escalations will meet a stronger response.",

In fact, India must use its media to propogate how easy F-16s were to be shot down during Sindoor and Balakot, even by a MIG-21. The propaganda must be done so much that for the next three generations, Indians must look down on American arms. This must be the lesson for the US arms lobby rewarding Pakistan using their state, and for Trump announcing the ceasefire before India like its his achievement. Just think about this, it is the US that has approached India on behalf of Pakistan for a ceasefire. India's objective was already achieved on May 7th with the intensive strikes against terrorists killing 70+ and flattening many of their pads. That's the message India wanted to give. And delivered. It is due to Pakistan's escalation that India had to retaliate for two more days. Everyday India gave an off-ramp for Pak which it didn't take. But once India struck their bases hard and destroyed air defences, Pakistan has gone crying to the US to help it stop India. This must have been done by Pakistan prostituting itself again in US interests for sure, by leaving the bed of China for time being. And the US steps in, asks India to accept Pak's ceasefire which anyway India wants. And once we agree, it acts like it is the peace broker. Just imgine if there was just 1 hour for PM Modi to appear on TV and announce the ceasefire himself. Telling us how badly Pak has been hit, and how India doesn't want this to spiral out, affecting us in the long term. And how the main objectives of imposing serious costs on Pakistan and teaching them a lesson was met. But the US, especially Trump, did not give the opportunity at all. This is nothing but shameless, courtesyless behavior. This is a direct snub to India. And I think India must take actions to ensure the US arms lobby that props up Pak pays. In fact, I really feel India must do just one more strike on Pak for yesterday's ceasefire violations and throw an egg on Trump's face while declaring ceasefire ourselves after the strike."

We will get it (PoK) back and military solution is the only solution.

Also, that military action that Pakistan instigated was absolutely uncalled for. You shouldn't have woken up a tiger who is sleeping, like India. Now that you have done it, that is the only solution.

Operation Sindoor has unequivocally established India's strategic military dominance in Asia. But at the same time, when the imperative need of the hour is national unity, the Congress party is politicising this whole situation by peddling fake narratives and showing baseless suspicions. This behaviour of the Congress party is reprehensible, especially at a time when the Indian Air Force has said operations are still underway. We have seen Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi asking for a special session of parliament... How do you call a session of parliament and discuss intricate details of national security?... After the statement from the MEA came, the Congress started comparing 2025 to 1971. How unfortunate is that? Everybody knows that in 1971, in fact, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw had said that Indira Gandhi forfeited the great victories brought by the Indian Armed Forces in 1971 in the Simla agreement and it was a great setback for India... We see what Operation Sindoor has done. The brave armed forces have destroyed 9 terror bases and 4 of them in Pakistan, killing hundreds of terrorists. Also, the Indian armed forces have decimated 11 Pakistan military installations and Pakistan air bases. Never has this been done before. So to draw a parallel between 1971 and 2025 is a folly. The Congress party should start playing a responsible role as the principal opposition and try to stand by national unity. And once again, we take this opportunity to thank our brave armed forces and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and we implicitly trust in our brave defence personnel and the leadership of the Prime Minister.\""

Which is the reason for the terror attack drawing us into a war. Perhaps India decided it won't play China's game and agreed to ceasefire though it will be a loss of face for Modi govt. But they can manage it internally as main elections are far away. So from tonight it will be claimed that some local commanders of Pak army unknowingly shelled, it is now calm, there is no violation of ceasefire to hold it. Pak and China run deep state media world over will mock India, Modi, Trump tomorrow and get away. We all will feel frustrated seeing their headlines seemingly suggesting India lost. Ceasefire may hold for sometime. But again China will instruct pak to break it. It will, at will, provoke India to respond. Or put our leadership in a decision dielema. We are, just because of this agreement, become a prisoner of Pak-China harkat at their will. That's all I will say.
